Academic Notes Sharing Platform
This project is an E-Notes Sharing Platform that allows the users to upload, download and manage
e-notes. Nowadays, with the fast-paced dynamic environment of the education system, it is not feasible
for the faculty or the students to manually circulate or manage the study material or notes, thereby arising
an obligation to manage this process through virtual automation. In such situations, due to technical issues
communication difficulties or perplexity due to various platforms, certain important information to be
passed on, or study material to be shared or any paperwork submission might face hindrances.
 In order to bridge this gap, there arises a need for a platform, exclusively satisfying the requirements of
this nodus. The E-Notes Sharing Platform serves as a perfect fit to resolve the complication faced by the
faculties and students alike. This platform allows the faculties to login to their accounts, upload important
notices and study material in the PDF format and manage them, likewise, it allows the students to view
the files uploaded by the faculties, download the same and also login to their accounts and upload any
assignments or paperwork given to them, which in turn can be viewed by the faculties.
Some prominent features of this platform:
• Multiple user access: Allows multiple type of users(teacher/student/admin) to login
• Functional Admin panel: Allows admins to manage the whole system
• Profile update option: Allows users to update their profile/account details
• Secure registration and login option for users
• Allows students and teachers to download/upload their course notes easily
• Allows users to recover their password using forgot password option

 Thus, the E-Notes Sharing Platform will be of great help in efficiently managing notes, study materials,
paperwork, assignments and notices in a hassle-free manner for the faculties as well as the students.
